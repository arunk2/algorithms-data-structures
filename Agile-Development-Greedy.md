Is Agile development Greedy?
============================
This post is not against Agile development. In fact I love agile development and been using it for a while. 

Lets begin - I am Not sure if someone else felt the same way.
Sometimes I feel that Agile development is more of a greedy approach.

## Argument goes as below:

- Team always work on the highest business value.
- Closes it and take the next highest item.

There is always a possibility in some project where a solution to less valued business item could be simpler and solves a complex part of higher business value. 
In other words there could be a global optimal point for the entire problem, 
but greedy based approach always reaches local maximum/minimum point. 
Hence, **Agile development => Greedy**

We all know that most of the time **greedy algorithms are not optimal**. But why it is so famous and more people try to adopt it.

## Why Greedy based solutions are accepted?
I don't know may be because people (customers) are greedy.

### Argument goes as below:
- Agile development gave relatively better results than other methodologies.
- People(customers/Business) tends evolve from some basic model. 
- They change very frequently and always wanted to have highest business valued item as early as possible.

What I feel is Even though Agile development adds more value to customers, it sometimes unnecessarily complicates software engineering.
By keeping the developers more focused on getting things working step-by-step. Innovation or out-of-box thinking are getting reduced.

May be that is the reason Agile is not followed for every type of projects. 
My point here is developers/organizations should not just follow the crowd to choose Agile methodology :-) unless it fits for them.
