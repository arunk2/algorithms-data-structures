Platform Independence : JEE Applications with Hibernate (on Linux and Windows)
===============================================================================

I almost spent an entire day on fixing this issue. Even though this is kind of a programming practice base error, 
this might be useful to someone.

We all know about Java being platform independent because of its platform 
independent byte code able to run in any platform (hardware + OS).
When Java compiler compiles - it generate intermediate code (byte code) not the native machine code (as in any other gcc like compilers). 
JVM interprets this byte code. we have differnt JVMs for different OS. 
Hence byte code compiled from any OS can be interpreted by any JVM => platform independence.

We will not talk about this here. 

One of my collegue showed me a scenario of a particular feature works in Tomcat running in Windows based box but not in Linux box. 
It is a JEE application (Struts + Spring + Hibernate).

**Root cause:** Linux is case sensitive

The problem is with the queries generated by hibernate are not getting executed in linux boxes. 
Table name had some upper characters for some HBM file, while the equivalent in DB are all lower cases.
When the HBM files are changed and deployed again, things worked as expected :-)
