As a developer or an organization, we need to make some choice of using open sourced products. 
I tried to compile some of the popular licenses types and actions needed by the user using them.


|	License Type	|	What needs to be done?	|	Remarks	|
|----------|----------|----------|
|	Apache 2.0	|	No action – if we are not distributing it as binary/source.   Else - We need to include(pack) the apache 2 license along with the component we are using. 	|	Apache license - has a few more restrictions. Notably, if you change any Apache-licensed code, you must state so. There are also rules about use of the project name. In order to redistribute software under this license, a licensee must offer a license to any of the licensee's patents that apply.	|
|	BSD	|	No action – if we are not distribution.    We need to include one line about the usage of it in our license/release file. And donot remove the copyright header from the top of source if we modify it.	|		|
|	GPL v2	|	No action – if we are not distributing it as binary/source.   Else – Make our component using it available open source under GPL	|		|
|	GPL v3	|	No action – if we are not distributing it as binary/source.   Else – Make our component using it available open source under GPL +Tivo-ization	|		|
|	LGPL v2	|	No action – if we are not distributing it as binary/source.   Else – Make our component using it available open source under GPL	|	The LGPL is similar to the GPL, but is more designed for software libraries where you want to allow non-GPL applications to link to your library and utilise it. If you modify the software, you still have to give back the source code, but you are allowed to link it with proprietary stuff without giving the source code to all of that back.	|
|	MIT License	|	No action – if we are not distribution.    We need to include one line about the usage if SocketIO in our license/release file. And donot remove the copyright header from the top of source if we modify it.	|	MIT license - lets people do anything they want with your code as long as they provide attribution back to you and don’t hold you liable. These licenses simply grant permission to copy the software, and disclaim warranty.	|
|	Mozilla Public License, version 2.0	|	No action – if we are not distributing it as binary/source.   Else - We need to include(pack) the MPL license along with the component we are using.                 If we change the source file – we need to make our modification as MPL	|	The MPL is a simple copyleft license. The MPL's "file-level" copyleft is designed to encourage contributors to share modifications they make to your code, while still allowing them to combine your code with code under other licenses (open or proprietary) with minimal restrictions.	|
|	PHP License / GPL	|	No action – if we are not distributing it as binary/source.   Else – Make our component using it available open source under GPL	|		|
|	Private – compatible with GPL v3	|	No action – if we are not distributing it as binary/source.   Else – Make our component using it available open source under GPL +Tivo-ization	|	GPL – If a software under GPL or a modified version of a GPL-ed software is released to the public, the distributor needs to make the source code, including the modified version if any, available to anyone who wants it.  Tivo-ization: they address the restrictions (like Tivo’s) in consumer products that take away, though hardware, the ability to modify the software.       The GNU General Public Licence, or GPL as it's often called, is the most popular free software licence and it's used by many different projects, including the Linux kernel, the GNU tools and literally hundreds of others.	|
|	WTFPL	|	Literally do anything. If needed we can claim the code to be ourself.	|	Beyond MIT/BSD license – abosutely free to use	|
